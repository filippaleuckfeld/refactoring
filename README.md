|------------------------------------------|------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|
|Rename field/method                       |low   |often         |more consistent naming, better readability      |everyone |
|Extract method/function                   |medium|often         |better readabilty, prepare for future code reuse|David    |
|Move method/type                          |low   |often         |better readability, more modular code           |David    |
|Componentization                          |high  |often         |separate code units with clear interfaces       |HÃ¥vard   |
|Remove Duplicated Code					   |medium|sometimes     |reduced code redundancy, improved maintainability, codebase will be easier to modify and update. | Filippa | 
|Field encapsulation                                 |low   |sometimes           | Provides more control over variables                                              |Carin      |
|Change static fields to singleton instance|high  |rarely        |makes code thread-safe; high effort due to having to rewrite much code to manage state and pass reference to given (singleton) object instance|no one(?)|
